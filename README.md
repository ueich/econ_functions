# econ_functions

Being an economist moving into quantitative analysis, I implement useful functions to perform causal inference in python. Formerly I mainly used Stata and R. This is a selection of helpful functions I started to use in my work that I formerly used in other languages. This could make it easier for other economists to transition to python.
